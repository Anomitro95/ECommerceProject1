Here is my first Ecommerce Project.

This project has been built on the basic principles of the 3 tier architecture abd Eclipse Neon was the IDE used. 

H2 database has been used in the backend, Spring MVC and Hibernate and Maven along with JSP has been used to build the
business logic layer or the middle(application) layer with Apache Tomcat 9.0 as the server and finally a combination of 
XML, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JSP and JavaScript has been used for the frontend or the presentation layer.

This is an initial model and there are indeed several areas of improvement and better UI implementation to be done from 
here on out.
